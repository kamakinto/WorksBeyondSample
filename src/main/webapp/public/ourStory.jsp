   	<p> Founded in 2014 by Everett Robinson and Oriane Rosenthal, Works Beyond promotes
      the sharing of ideas among underrepresented Nations around the world.This is accomplished through
     proiding translation services to those we serve.</p>
     
     <p> (company name) translation services focus on the sharing of critical publications amongst the scholars around the world. We understand 
       that there is an apparent lack of equal representation among non-english written publications within the science community.
       Our goal is to provide the tools necessary to break language barriers, and 
       promote understanding among nations.</p>
