WorksBeyondSample
=================
WorksBeyond is a project focused on sharing non-English, underrepresented scholarly works, and bringing them to the forefront of
English speaking nations. The site will work to allow viewers to sample the scholarly works, share them on social networks,
and download the publications. The idea is focused around giving non-English speaking countries the chance to share their
work with others in English. The goal is to promote understanding amongst nations. 

Please find the two sample videos that demonstrate some of the features withing the Web application.
